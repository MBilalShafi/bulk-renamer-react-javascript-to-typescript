# Port React to Typescript

This utility renames the file extentions of a React.js project on Javascript to React.js on TypeScript.

### How it Works?

It renames extentions as following:

.js => .ts for normal JS files.
.js => .tsx for JSX components (that render something)

### Usage:

Place in the root folder of project and run with python 3.

### Open for Contribution:

If you want to improve the code you can open a pull request.

Thanks
